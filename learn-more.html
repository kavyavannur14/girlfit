        <h2>What is Menstruation?</h2>
        <p>The menstrual cycle is a complex, natural process that occurs in the female reproductive system, preparing the body for a potential pregnancy. It is regulated by a finely tuned interplay of hormones and typically spans around 28 days, though it can range from 21 to 35 days in different individuals. The cycle includes several phases: the menstrual phase, follicular phase, ovulation, and luteal phase ‚Äî each playing a distinct role in reproductive health.</p>
        
        <h2>The Phases of the Menstrual Cycle:</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Menstrual Phase</h3>
        <p>This is the first stage, marked by the shedding of the uterine lining, which exits the body through the vagina. This bleeding, commonly referred to as a "period," lasts for 3 to 7 days and involves a mix of blood, mucus, and tissue.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Follicular Phase</h3>
        <p>Starting on the first day of menstruation and ending with ovulation, this phase involves the maturation of follicles in the ovaries under the influence of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). One dominant follicle will prepare to release an egg.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Ovulation</h3>
        <p>Around mid-cycle, a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers the release of a mature egg from the ovary. This is the most fertile period of the cycle, and fertilization is most likely if sperm are present in the reproductive tract.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Luteal Phase</h3>
        <p>After ovulation, the ruptured follicle becomes the corpus luteum and secretes progesterone to maintain the uterine lining. If fertilization doesn't occur, hormone levels drop, leading to the next menstrual period.</p>

    <h2>üå∫ There's Another Side to Periods...</h2>
    <p>Up to this point, we've explored how periods are a natural and essential part of growing up. But sometimes, things don't go as expected. There's another side ‚Äî where periods become irregular, painful, or stop showing up entirely. This could be a sign of a common but often misunderstood conditions known as <strong>PCOD</strong> (Polycystic Ovarian Disorder) or <strong>PCOS</strong> (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome).</p>
    <p>Recognizing the symptoms early can make a big difference. Let's understand PCOD, PCOS and how they can affect girls and women ‚Äî physically and emotionally.</p>
